# Problem: 

The task is to scrape the gigs section of Craigslist Boston and figure out how much money someone could make per day if they did all the gigs. You can use whatever frameworks or approaches you want to scrape and parse the data. You don't have to handle every edge case, but we'd like to see a strong first pass at the problem. 

In the end, you will: 
- Give us your best final answer (e.g. you can make $1000/day) 
- Send us your code 
- Discuss your implementation and how you approached the task 

# Suggestions: 

While you can use any framework/tool to accomplish this we would suggest python+selenium considering what this role would be. You could likely implement this via a couple of lines of Scrapy and the CL RSS but that's not what we are looking for. 

We would like you to pretend this is a dark-web forum. Access and harvest data from it in a 'human' manner. 

Note: Craigslist will ban you if you hit them with too many requests. Write code that you would like to see in a production environment.
